# weather-app
Built a responsive “Weather App” in React — set up the front-end using Create-React-App (or Vite), structured components logically, managed state with React Hooks (useState, useEffect), and integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, conditions) based on user input.
